# Webpack 4 Learning notes

## Useful Commands 

Run webpack from node_modules (no need install webpack globally)

        ./node_modules/.bin/webpack  
or run this command

        npx wepback
Webpack default config file name is **"webpack.config.js".**
To run webpack with custom config file name use this command
        
        npx webpack --config my.custom.webpack.config.js
so webpack will look config file with name **"my.custom.webpack.config.js"**.
